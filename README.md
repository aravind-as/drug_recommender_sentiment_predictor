# A brief about the work
This work aims to analyse the sentiment of drug reviews, create a machine learning model for sentiment classification of such reviews, and recommend the best suitable drugs for a specific health condition. 
I have used a drug review datasetavailable publicly in the UCI ML repository for the analysis and sentiment classification.The Random Forest Classifier model is used for sentiment classification and developed 
a web application using streamlit that gives sentiment of the review that is inputted by the user and suggest drugs for selected health condition based on sentiment through a collaborative filtering approach.
